# Front-end Developer Test
Using any frontend framework of your choice, build a star wars directory using [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/), which has all api details required for the applicatoion.

## Functional requirements
- User can view a list of people (humans & robots). List item should contain full name, birth year and gender
- User can view a list of planets, list item should contain name, temperature and population.
- User can view a list of starships, list item should contain name, model and cargo capacity.
- User can see full details of selected person, planet or starship, you can ignore data containing links in the JSON response.
- For each listing, user can search using name to filter the list
- User should be able to filter based on gender in the people section (male, female, robot)

Note that for each listing, you can decide to show all data at once based on your preference (i.e rather than having each list item for people showing just name, birth and gender, full details can be shown if it can be neatly formatted) hence there wouldn't be need for a view showing full details of selected list item.

## General requirements
A single page application using a modern JS library/framework (Vue/React/Angular) featuring:
- A visually pleasing experience, you donâ€™t have to be a designer but you must have put an effort into making this look good
- A "componentized" approach, split your code into small building blocks, showcase your clean architecture skills.
- CSS can be written using PostCSS, SASS, LESS or similar higher-level language

## Nice to have
- Responsive design

## What we're looking for
- Using high-quality existing libraries or small amounts of custom code
- Production grade code (clean, maintainable, reusable code)
- A detailed commit history shows your progress towards your final implementation
- Polish and visual creativity
- Pride in craftsmanship

## Extra Bonus Points
The following items will earn you bonus points. They are not requirements, the challenge is 100% completeable without them. 
- Use Vue/React which is our frontend stack
- Include animation / Micro-interactions

Finally, we'd like to say *Good luck! And have fun!*
